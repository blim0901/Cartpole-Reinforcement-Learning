# Cartpole-Reinforcement-Learning
Using a cart pole environment implemented by the gym library, a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart. In this project, my team developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The trained agent makes the decision to push the cart to the left or right based on the cart position, velocity, and the pole angle, angular velocity. The goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible.
